# demo_spring_boot
My follow through code on the Spring boot tutorial by amigoscode.
In this tutorial we perfomed simple CRUD operations on a database and serve these to the client.
This is just me following through, to make sure I also implement along and understand the logic and 
the series of steps and how to think like a spring developer and most importantly, that I understand the concepts.
